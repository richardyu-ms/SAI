## Overriew
The purpose of this test plan is to test the VLAN function from SAI.

### Testbed
Those tests will be run on the testbed structure, the components are:
* PTF - running in a server that can connect to the target DUT
* SAI server - running on a dut
*P.S. All the tests are target on T0 scenario.*
## Scope
The test will include three parts
1. Vlan functionalities
   - Flooding
   - Forwarding
   - Access
   - Untagging(802.1Q)
   - ARP 
2. SAI APIs operations
   - Vlan Counters
   - Vlan and member list operations
3. Composit scenario
   - VLAN Interface (RIF/SVI)

## Basic Configurations and SAI APIs
During testing, we need to use SAI APIs for testing. By using the SAI-PTF structure, we can invoke the SAI with RPC APIs remotely, the sample code is below.
### Testbed stablization and impact
Cause the test bed might also encounter some issue, like the host interface is down. 
Before run the actual test there will be need some sanity test to check the DUT status, and select the active ports for testing.

**Then all the port indexes in this test plan just to illustarate the test purpose, they are not exactlly the same for the actual environment, please make adjustment as needed.**

### Basic VLAN configuration
|VLAN ID|Ports|Tag mode|HostIf
|-|-|-|-|
|1000|Port1-24|Untag|Ethernet4-96|

|VLAN connection|Ports|Tag mode|
|-|-|-|
|1000|Port1-24|Untag|

### Create VLAN and VLAN member
- Create Vlan 1000
   ```Python
   sai_thrift_create_vlan(self.client, vlan_id=1000)
   ```
- Create Native vlan 1000
   ```python
   sai_thrift_set_port_attribute(self.client, port_id, port_vlan_id=1000)
   ```
- Create Vlan member and VLAN member with different mode
   Untag mode and access port
   ```python
    ----------------------------------
    |VLAN ID|Ports|Tag mode| HostIf  |
    |-------|-----|--------|---------|
    | 1000  |Port1| Untag  |Ethernet4|
    ----------------------------------

   sai_thrift_create_vlan_member(
                    self.client,
                    vlan_id=1000,
                    bridge_port_id=port_bridge_port1,
                    vlan_tagging_mode=SAI_VLAN_TAGGING_MODE_UNTAGGED)

   ```

### Basic Forwarding Table
For testing, we can use basic FDB APIs to Add the FDB entry into CAM. The Rule as below
|Name|MAC|PORT|VLAN|HostIf|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|fdb0|mac0-00:00:00:00:00:11|Port0||Ethernet0|
|fdb1-24  |mac1-00:11:11:11:11:11 - mac24-02:55:55:55:55:55|Port1-24|1000|Ethernet4-Ethernet96|
|fdb25-32|mac25-02:55:55:55:55:55 - mac31-03:11:11:11:11:11|Port25-32||Ethernet100-Ethernet128|



### Create FDB Entry

- Add static FDB entry in the FDB table
   
  In the sample code below, we can see how to create FDB entry.

  This FDB entry is a static entry, it will ``forward`` packet when the packet with a mac1 on port1.
   ```python
    ----------------------------------------------------
    | MAC   |Ports| VLAN     | Type | Action | HostIf  |
    |-------|-----|----------|--------------------------
    | mac1  |Port1| vlan_oid |STATIC| FORWARD|Ethernet4|
    ----------------------------------------------------

   sai_thrift_fdb_entry_t(switch_id=self.switch_id, mac_address=mac1, bv_id=self.vlan_oid)
   sai_thrift_create_fdb_entry(
                self.client,
                fdb_entry,
                type=SAI_FDB_ENTRY_TYPE_STATIC,
                bridge_port_id=Port1,
                packet_action=SAI_PACKET_ACTION_FORWARD)
   ```

- FDB operations
  Get FDB entries
  ```python
  sai_thrift_get_switch_attribute(
            self.client,
            available_fdb_entry=True)
  ```
- Clear FDB entries
  Clear the learned FDB entries with the VLAN id object id
  ```python
  sai_thrift_flush_fdb_entries(
                    self.client,
                    bv_id=self.vlan_oid,
                    entry_type=SAI_FDB_ENTRY_TYPE_DYNAMIC)
  ```

### Packet example
- Tagged packet with VLAN id 

   When a packet sent to a access port or send out from a access port, we will get a packet without the VLAN id.
   *In T0, we don't need to test tagged packet.*
   ```python
    tagged_packet(eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11',
                eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
                vlan_vid=1000,
                ip_dst='172.16.0.1',
                ip_ttl=64)
   ```
- Untagged packet
  ```Python
    simple_tcp_packet(eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11',
                      eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
                      ip_dst='172.16.0.1',
                      ip_ttl=64)
  ```
  
## Tests

### Test Case: VLAN-Interface (SVI) 
**Testing Objective**

Testing L3 switch, VLAN-Interface(SVI) in layer3 for packet routing.

In this case, it will cover the scenarios like
- Server to T1 (north/south)
- Server to Server (east/west)
#### Test the configuration 
For VLAN-Interface(SVI), it can be configured from a config_db.json. This json file, can be generated from a xml config as below. Base on this configuration we can see what the actual configuration will be.

```xml
 <DeviceL3Info Hostname="SONIC-0101-0522-08T0">
    <VlanInterface Name="s1h" AttachTo="Ethernet6/1;Ethernet7/1;Ethernet8/1" vlanid="608" tag="608" Subnets="10.95.88.208/28" Type="AzureCompute" />
    <IPInterface AttachTo="s1h" Prefix="10.95.88.209/28" />
    <IPInterface AttachTo="s1h" Prefix="2603:10a0:31c:8144::1/64" />
  </DeviceL3Info>
```
Convert to config_db.json
```json
    "VLAN": {
        "Vlan608": {
            "members": [
                "Ethernet6/1",
                "Ethernet7/1",
                "Ethernet8/1",
				],
            "vlanid": "608"
        }
    },
    "VLAN_INTERFACE": {
        "Vlan608": {},
        "Vlan608|10.95.88.209/28": {},
        "Vlan608|2603:10a0:31c:8144::1/64": {}
    },
    "VLAN_MEMBER": {
        "Vlan608|Ethernet6/1": {
            "tagging_mode": "untagged"
        },
        "Vlan608|Ethernet7/1": {
            "tagging_mode": "untagged"
        },
        "Vlan608|Ethernet8/1": {
            "tagging_mode": "untagged"
        },
    }
```

|-|-|-|-|
|192.168.0.1|vlanInterface(VLAN1000)|192.168.1.1(SVI_IP)|PORTMAC|

- Create Router for a VLAN interface (not used in currernt test, just for explain the route creation.)
  ```Python
  self.vlan100_rif = sai_thrift_create_router_interface(
            self.client,
            type=SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_TYPE_VLAN,
            virtual_router_id=self.default_vrf,
            vlan_id=self.vlan1000)

  self.nhop1 = sai_thrift_create_next_hop(
        self.client,
        ip=sai_ipaddress(next_hop_ip), #SVI_IP
        router_interface_id=self.vlan100_rif,
        type=SAI_NEXT_HOP_TYPE_IP)
  self.neighbor_entry1 = sai_thrift_neighbor_entry_t(
            rif_id=self.vlan1000_rif, 
            ip_address=sai_ipaddress(next_hop_ip))#SVI_IP
  #Nhop to vlan interface
  sai_thrift_create_neighbor_entry(
            self.client, self.neighbor_entry1, 
            dst_mac_address=self.portmac) #Dest port mac, i.e port15:mac15 in vlan1000
  #Route to vlan interface
  self.route_entry1 = sai_thrift_route_entry_t(
            vr_id=self.default_vrf, 
            destination=sai_ipprefix(pkt_dest_ip+'/32')) # Packet dest IP
  sai_thrift_create_route_entry(
            self.client, self.route_entry1, next_hop_id=self.nhop1)
  ```

#### VLAN interface input packet
  ```Python
  simple_tcp_packet(
            eth_dst=SVI_MAC,
            eth_src=SRC_MAC,
            ip_dst=DEST_IP,
            ip_src=SRC_IP)
  ```

#### VLAN interface output packet
  ```Python
  simple_tcp_packet(
            eth_dst=PORT_MAC, 
            eth_src=SVI_MAC, #Switch MAC

### Test suite: Basic function - Untagging and access

This is a basic funcation testing. This test suite will cover the basic VLAN function around untag and access port.

*p.s. This test will not check function with native VLAN scenario (it will be in other tests). Please make sure the native VLAN will not impact the result.*

**Testing Objective**

                                                                | SRCPORT:MAC1 = DMAC|
  pkt(Untag:DMAC):vlan:10 -> SRCPORT(Access:10)  -> |DUT| -> |FDB|                    | -> X 
                                                                | MAC2               |

```
Precondition/Setup:
- Create VLAN as the basic configuration.
- Create an FDB table as a basic configuration.
- Add a non-existing ``MacX`` to port1

| Goal |Steps |  Expect  |
|-|-|-|
| Filter frame. | Send VLAN100 ``Untagged`` packet with dest ``MacX`` on ``port1``. |Packet dropped|
| Filter frame. | Send VLAN100 ``Untagged`` packet with dest ``MAC1`` on ``port1``. |Packet dropped|

### Composit scenario: ARP Flooding and learn
- ARP request
  ```Python
  simple_arp_packet(
            eth_dst='FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF', # boardcast
            eth_src='00:11:11:11:11:11',
            arp_op=1,  # ARP request
            ip_tgt='10.10.10.2',
            ip_snd='10.10.10.1',
            hw_snd='00:11:11:11:11:11',
            hw_tgt="00:00:00:00:00:00")
  ```
- ARP response
  ```Python
  Untagged:

  simple_arp_packet(
            eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11', 
            eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
            arp_op=2,  # ARP response
            ip_tgt='10.10.10.1',
            ip_snd='10.10.10.2',
            hw_snd='00:22:22:22:22:22',
            hw_tgt="00:11:11:11:11:11")
  Tagged:

  simple_arp_packet(
            eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11', 
            eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
            arp_op=2,  # ARP response
            ip_tgt='10.10.10.1',
            ip_snd='10.10.10.2',
            vlan_vid=1000,
            hw_snd='00:22:22:22:22:22',
            hw_tgt="00:11:11:11:11:11")
  ```

In the ARP scenario, the mac learning process is:
1. Send an ARP request, with the source MAC, dest IP, and src IP, for broadcast, the DST MAC is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
2. After the encountered device get the ARP packet and sends out a response, the packet will be filled with a source mac, this is the target device mac for the dest IP.
3. Switch received that response, cause the switch learned a MAC on step 1 on the sending port, then it can make a unicast here.

**p.s. The test will be ended here, will not test the send from the port in step 1 again, it is already covered in other tests.**

**Testing Description**

Testing ARP scernairo
```
Test example:
1. ARP Request                                  
                                                                
  ARP Req pkt(Untag:DMAC) ->  (access:10)|DUT| -> Flooding -> VLAN:10 -> pkt(Untag):VLAN10:Access

2. ARP Response 
  pkt(access:10)|DUT| <- Forward(FDB:MAC=DMAC) <- VLAN:10:PORT <- RP Resp pkt(Untag:10:DMAC)

```
Precondition/Setup:
- Create VLAN as the basic configuration.

| Goal | Steps | Expect  |
|-|-|-|
| ARP Request flooding to all ports. | Send ``Untagged`` ARP packet with dest ``mac4`` on ``port1``. |``Untagged`` Packets from ``Access``, ``Untagged`` Packet from ``Access``|
| Mac learned from ARP request and ARP response.| Send a ``Untagged`` ARP response packet with src:mac4, dest:mac1 to port4 and check the FDB entries.|Unicast happened.|
| FDB entries added.| Call API to check the FDB entries.|New mac entries in CAM.|

## SAI APIs operations

### Test case: Vlan member list.
**Testing Objective**

Test VLAN and member list.

Sample APIs

Get VLAN member list
```Python
 vlan_member_list = sai_thrift_object_list_t(count=100)
        mbr_list = sai_thrift_get_vlan_attribute(
            self.client, self.vlan10, member_list=vlan_member_list)
```

nagtive test
```python
    vlan_attr = sai_thrift_get_vlan_attribute(
        self.client, vlan_oid=1000, learn_disable=True)

    incorrect_member = sai_thrift_create_vlan_member(
        self.client,
        vlan_id=1000,
        bridge_port_id=self.port27_bp,
        vlan_tagging_mode=SAI_VLAN_TAGGING_MODE_UNTAGGED)
```

Precondition/Setup:
- Create VLAN as the basic configuration.
- Create an FDB table as a basic configuration.


| Steps/Cases | Goal | Expect  |
|-|-|-|
| VLAN member list and member count are right. |Use the SAI API to check the VLAN member |  Vlan member list.|
| VLAN and its member removed.|Remove the VLAN member from VLAN 10 and remove VLAN. |  VLAN and its member removed.|
| Error when creating member to un-exist VLAN. |Use the SAI API to create a VLAN member on VLAN 10 |  Vlan attribute is 0.|

### Test case: Test VLAN related counters.
**Testing Objective**

For VLAN-related counters, SAI should be able to get the counter and clear them.

Below is the sample API to operate those data

Check counters
```Python
        stats = sai_thrift_get_vlan_stats(self.client, self.vlan10)
        in_bytes = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_IN_OCTETS"]
        out_bytes = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_OUT_OCTETS"]
        in_packets = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_IN_PACKETS"]
        in_ucast_packets = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_IN_UCAST_PKTS"]
        out_packets = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_OUT_PACKETS"]
        out_ucast_packets = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_OUT_UCAST_PKTS"]

```
Clear counters
```Python
sai_thrift_clear_vlan_stats(self.client, self.vlan10)
```

Precondition/Setup:
- Create VLAN as the basic configuration.
- Create an FDB table as a basic configuration.

| Goal |Steps/Cases |  Expect  |
|-|-|-|
| Forwarding, ``VLAN10`` ``Untagged`` packet on ``Native`` from a ``VLAN10`` ``Access``.|Send ``Untagged`` packet with dest ``mac3`` on ``port5``. |  ``Untagged`` packet received on port3.|
| Counter Changed accordingly.|Use the SAI API to check the counters | Counter increased, bytes counter: OCTETS increased, other counters + 1|
|  Counter reset.|Use the SAI API to clear the counters.| Related counter is reset to zero. |
