## Overriew
The purpose of this test plan is to test the VLAN function from SAI.

### Test Topology
For SAI-PTF, it will use a non-topology network structure for the sai testing. 

![Device_topology](img/SAI_PTF_Topology.jpg)
### Testbed
Those tests will be run on the testbed structure as below, the components are:
* PTF - running in a server that can connect to the target DUT
* SAI server - running on a dut
  
![Device_topology](img/Device_topology.jpg)

*p.s. cause the SAI testing will not depend on any sonic components, then there will be no specific topology(T0 T1 T2) for testing.*
## Scope
The test will include three parts
1. Vlan functionalities
   - Flooding
   - Forwarding
   - Trunk/Access
   - Tagging/Untagging(802.1Q)
   - VLAN interface (RIF/SVI) 
2. SAI APIs operations
   - Vlan Counters
   - Vlan and member list operations

## Basic Test data and SAI APIs
During testing, we need to use SAI APIs for testing. By using SAI-PTF structure, we can invoke the SAI with RPC APIs remotely, the sample code is below.
### Create VLAN and VLAN member
- Create Vlan 10
   ```Python
   sai_thrift_create_vlan(self.client, vlan_id=10)
   ```
- Create Native vlan
   ```python
   sai_thrift_set_port_attribute(self.client, port_id, port_vlan_id=10)
   ```
- Create Vlan member and VLAN member with different mode
   Untag mode and access port
   ```python
   sai_thrift_create_vlan_member(
                    self.client,
                    vlan_id=10,
                    bridge_port_id=port_bridge_port,
                    vlan_tagging_mode=SAI_VLAN_TAGGING_MODE_UNTAGGED)
   ```
   Tag mode and trunk port
   ```python
   sai_thrift_create_vlan_member(
                    self.client,
                    vlan_id=10,
                    bridge_port_id=port_bridge_port,
                    vlan_tagging_mode=SAI_VLAN_TAGGING_MODE_TAGGED)
   ```
- Add static FDB entry in the FDB table
   
   In the code below, we can create fdb entry, and bind the SMAC with a port with a static dfb entry.
   ```python
   sai_thrift_fdb_entry_t(switch_id=self.switch_id, mac_address=mac1, bv_id=self.vlan_oid)
   sai_thrift_create_fdb_entry(
                self.client,
                fdb_entry,
                type=SAI_FDB_ENTRY_TYPE_STATIC,
                bridge_port_id=port_bp,
                packet_action=SAI_PACKET_ACTION_FORWARD)
   ```
- Fdb operations
  Get Fdb entries
  ```python
  sai_thrift_get_switch_attribute(
            self.client,
            available_fdb_entry=True)
  ```
- Clear fdb entries
  Clear the learned fdb entries with the VLAN id object id
  ```python
  sai_thrift_flush_fdb_entries(
                    self.client,
                    bv_id=self.vlan_oid,
                    entry_type=SAI_FDB_ENTRY_TYPE_DYNAMIC)
  ```

### Packet example
- Tagged packet with VLAN id 

   When a packet sent to a access port or send out from a access port, we will get a packet with the VLAN id.
   ```python
    tagged_packet(eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11',
                eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
                vlan_vid=10,
                ip_dst='172.16.0.1',
                ip_ttl=64)
   ```
- ARP request
  ```Python
  simple_arp_packet(
            eth_dst='FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF', # boardcast
            eth_src='00:11:11:11:11:11',
            arp_op=1,  # ARP request
            ip_tgt='10.10.10.2',
            ip_snd='10.10.10.1',
            hw_snd='00:11:11:11:11:11',
            hw_tgt="00:00:00:00:00:00")
  ```
- ARP response
  ```Python
  simple_arp_packet(
            eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11', 
            eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
            arp_op=2,  # ARP response
            ip_tgt='10.10.10.1',
            ip_snd='10.10.10.2',
            hw_snd='00:22:22:22:22:22',
            hw_tgt="00:11:11:11:11:11")
  ```
- Untagged packet
  ```Python
    simple_tcp_packet(eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11',
                      eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
                      ip_dst='172.16.0.1',
                      ip_ttl=64)
  ```

## Test Suites
*p.s. We can extend this test to each port with a loop, just take smaple amount of ports as example.*


### Test suite #1 : Test Flooding and learn

#### Testing Objective
Those tests will verifies flooding and learning for vlan. 

VLANs divide broadcast domains in a LAN environment. When flooding on a trunk port with match vlan, the boadcast should only happened within vlan.

After save the mac address to forwarding table, only unicast will happen with target mac.

ARP request and response will also be covered in this set.

        in_ucast_packets = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_IN_UCAST_PKTS"]
        out_packets = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_OUT_PACKETS"]
        out_ucast_packets = stats["SAI_VLAN_STAT_OUT_UCAST_PKTS"]
